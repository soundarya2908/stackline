## Commands

### Run

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the project directory, you can run: `npm build`

This creates a folder called dist in the root directory with all the compiled files. This can be used for production.
